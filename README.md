## 🌐 Routing Structure

* `/` → Home Page
* `/shop` → Product Listing
* `/product/:id` → Product Details
* `/cart` → Cart Page
* `/login` → Login Page
* `/checkout` → Protected Page
* `/contact` → Contact Page

---

## 🔐 Authentication Logic

* User clicks **"Login as Guest"**
* User state is set to authenticated
* Protected routes check user state
* Unauthorized users are redirected to `/login`
